# Contributing to SBCM Alliance / Yorbee

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Yorbee!
We are a collective of civic hackers aiming to fix the structural bugs in public administration and the labor market.

## 🤝 How to Contribute
We welcome all forms of contribution:
*   **Bug Fixes & Refactoring** (especially Python/Streamlit backend)
*   **Documentation** (Installation guides, API docs)
*   **Feature Requests & Ideas** (via Issues)

## 🚫 Core Logic Policy (IMPORTANT)
SBCM is based on a strict theoretical framework.
**Please do NOT modify the following core parameters/formulas without prior discussion in Issues:**

*   **Standard Block ($B_{std}$):** Fixed at 72,176.
*   **Distortion Index ($D_{index}$):** The calculation logic must remain consistent.
*   **G-Cart Protocol:** The logic for mesh refinement and leakage prevention.

*These are the "Physical Laws" of our system. Changing them arbitrarily breaks the simulation.*

## 📝 Pull Request Guidelines
We don't have strict rules, but the following format is appreciated:

### Title Format
Please use a prefix to describe the change:
*   `[Feat]` : New features
*   `[Fix]` : Bug fixes
*   `[Docs]` : Documentation changes
*   `[Style]` : UI/Design adjustments (CSS, Layout)
*   `[Refactor]` : Code restructuring without behavior changes

**Example:** `[Docs] Add installation steps for Arch Linux`

### Description
